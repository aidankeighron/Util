```java
// Java code for serialization and deserialization 
// of a Java object
import java.io.*;
  

/*
 * Description for Output:
You have seen while deserializing the object the values of a and b has changed. The reason being a was marked as transient and b was static.
In case of transient variables:- A variable defined with transient keyword is not serialized during serialization process.This variable will 
be initialized with default value during deserialization. (e.g: for objects it is null, for int it is 0).
In case of static Variables:- A variable defined with static keyword is not serialized during serialization process.
This variable will be loaded with current value defined in the class during deserialization.

Points to remember
1. If a parent class has implemented Serializable interface then child class doesn’t need to implement it but vice-versa is not true.
2. Only non-static data members are saved via Serialization process.
3. Static data members and transient data members are not saved via Serialization process.So, if you don’t want to save value of a non-static data member then make it transient.
4. Constructor of object is never called when an object is deserialized.
5. Associated objects must be implementing Serializable interface.
Example :
 */
class Emp implements Serializable {
private static final long serializationUID = 129348938L;
    transient int a;
    static int b;
    String name;
    int age;
  
    // Default constructor
public Emp(String name, int age, int a, int b)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
    }
}
  
public class Serialization {
public static void printData(Emp object1)
    {
  
        System.out.println("name = " + object1.name);
        System.out.println("age = " + object1.age);
        System.out.println("a = " + object1.a);
        System.out.println("b = " + object1.b);
    }

            out.writeObject(object);
